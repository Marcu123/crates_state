Clone the crates.io index repo.

Read the information about all the crates. Take into consideration only the most recent version of a crate. Print to a file the following information:

the crate with the most dependencies (and the dependencies)
the crate with the most dependants (and the dependants)
the crate with the most features (and the features)
the crate with the most versions.

I used threads for the above problems.
